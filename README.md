# MNIST-SGDClassifier-Binary-Classification
This repository contains a machine learning project utilizing a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier for binary classification on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to identify and classify handwritten digits.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a popular dataset consisting of 70,000 small images of handwritten digits. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents.

## Model Selection
In this project, we perform binary classification to distinguish between zeros and non-zeros. We use the SGD classifier, a simple yet powerful linear model, particularly suited for large datasets, to perform the binary classification task.

## Performance evaluation process

***

**Classification Report**

We generate a report detailing key metrics such as precision, recall, and f1-score for each class.

***

**Precision-Recall Curve**

We plot a precision-recall curve to visualize the trade-off between precision and recall for different threshold settings.

***

**Confusion Matrix**

We use a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the algorithm by displaying the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.

***

**K-Fold Cross-Validation**

We use a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the algorithm by displaying the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.
