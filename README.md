# MNIST-SGDClassifier-Binary-Classification
This repository contains a machine learning project utilizing a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier for binary classification on the MNIST dataset. The goal is to identify and classify handwritten digits.
**See the Jupyter Notebook file for the complete project**

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 small images of handwritten digits. Each image is labeled with the digit it represents.

## Model Selection
In this project, binary classification was performed to distinguish between zeros and non-zeros. The SGD classifier was used to perform the binary classification task.
